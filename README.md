# Music APP

## Technologies Used

### FrontEnd
- React
- Redux
- Bootstrap
- Axios

### BackEnd
- Express

## To run the app follow the below steps:
- go to the root of the project
- now run `npm run bootstrap`
- once the build is complete then run `npm start` 
- once app started successfully visit http://localhost:5000 [default]

## App Functionalities

The app contains a search bar to search **artist/band/group**.
If will send a request to the **musicBrainz** api and show the result if found.

If an artist contains a list of albums then those can be viewed by clicking on the albums button.

There a separate page for the albums to view the cover arts & album songs with a dummy play/pause button. Couldn't implement the real song play as there is no media url provided by the musicBrainz api.
